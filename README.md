# Brief Data Science Concept Stories

_Brief Data Science Concept Stories_ encloses my overview of certain topics and my practical experiments in the field of _Data Science_, as its name implies, in a short form.

## Issue 1

In the first issue, named as _Overview of Statistical Learning_, I overviewed the concept of statistical learning guided by _An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python_ written by James et al. (2020). The objective was to revisit the fundamental aspects of statistical and machine learning techniques and reconstruct datasets and visuals presented in the referenced work.

The issue itself can be found [here](./overview-of-statistical-learning/Brief%20Data%20Science%20Concepts%20-%20Overview%20of%20Statistical%20Learning.pdf), while the associated notebook is accessible [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthew-balogh/bdscs/blob/main/overview-of-statistical-learning/overview-of-statistical-learning.ipynb).
